# Filipino-Timeline

(Work in progress)

This website contains a timeline of American movies and tv shows that featured Filipino/part-Filipino characters starting from the 1940s and up to the present.
A youtube clip of the film or tv show will appear on the bottom of the timeline when it is clicked. The title, year, and a list of Filipino characters
will also be displayed on the bottom of the clip.

The website uses the visjs library to create the timeline. It also uses YouTube's IFrame API to load the videos.
